# Postgresql-TDE
## Postgresql transparent data encryption is not support officially by PG community. But serveral commercial or open source third party build TDE on Postgresql old version, my target is to build transparent data encryption feature on PG latest version (12.1).
## I do not re-invent the wheel since Cybertech, other company already implement this feature in PG 9.6, I plan to port this implementation into PG last version. (https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/products/postgresql-transparent-data-encryption/)
